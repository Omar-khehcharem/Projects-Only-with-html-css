Zorzor Web Design
Overview
This project is a simple web page design built using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates basic layout and styling techniques, but the design was not created by me. The fonts used in this project are not the correct ones intended for the design, and there is still room for improvement, especially in typography and design refinement.

Features
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling and layout
Basic responsiveness
Clean and simple design
Acknowledgements
The design for this project is not original; it was adapted from an external source.

Further refining the layout and spacing.
Adding more interactive elements using JavaScript in future versions.
